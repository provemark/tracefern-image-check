## Problem

The plugin directory has some thirty plugins that label AI images, most
for the EU AI Act's Article 50, and many say they "detect" AI images
through C2PA. A visitor comparing them cannot tell from `readme.txt` that
this plugin does something they do not: it verifies the credentials
instead of trusting what the file says about itself. The short
description ("Checks the Content Credentials…") reads like theirs.

Measured 2026-09-28, in WordPress Playground with the default settings,
four such plugins from the directory against the fixtures of SPEC-024
(a Pixel 10 photo, an OpenAI image, the same image with one byte of image
data changed, an Amazon Titan image, an unsigned image):

- three of the four labelled the changed AI image exactly as the intact
  one; the fourth did not see the C2PA data at all;
- two of the four labelled the camera photo as AI-generated, one because
  any C2PA manifest counts as AI, one because the manifest's
  `c2pa.created` action does.

In the C2PA code of thirteen directory plugins that read C2PA, no call
that checks a signature or a hash was found (a code search; measured that
the code is absent, not how each plugin behaves).

The page should say this plainly, without naming anyone and without
claims the plugin cannot back: what it checks, and the two ways a
check-by-presence goes wrong. Directory guideline 9 ("Developers and
their plugins must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally
offensive") and the community's expectations argue against naming or
disparaging other plugins; a description of the two patterns is enough,
and anyone can repeat the test with the public fixtures.

## Scope

**In scope**, `readme.txt` only:

- The short description (the line under the name in search results):

  > Verifies the Content Credentials (C2PA) of uploaded images (signature,
  > image hash and signer) and shows the verdict in the Media Library.

  137 characters; the directory allows 150.

- A first paragraph in `== Description ==`:

  > **Verified, not just detected.** Finding a C2PA manifest in a file is
  > easy; knowing whether it is genuine is not. A manifest can be copied
  > onto another image, and an image can be changed after it was signed
  > while its manifest still claims what it did before. Tracefern checks
  > the signature, the hash that ties the manifest to the image's own
  > bytes, and the signer's certificate against the C2PA trust lists.
  > Only when the signature and the hash hold does it show "AI-generated
  > (signed)", and only when the signer is also on the trust list does it
  > say "Verified".

  The last sentence follows SPEC-003: the label shows on `Trusted` and on
  `Valid` ("Intact: signer not trusted"), both of which mean the
  signature and the hash hold; "Verified" is `Trusted` only. (The draft
  shown to Maurice said "only when all of that holds … only then does it
  show" the label, which would have claimed too much.)

- A first question in `== Frequently Asked Questions ==`:

  > = How is this different from plugins that label AI images? =
  >
  > Many plugins look for C2PA or IPTC metadata and label an image as
  > AI-generated when they find it. Some count any C2PA manifest as AI,
  > so a camera photo with Content Credentials is labelled AI-generated.
  > Others read what the manifest claims without checking it, so an AI
  > image that was changed after signing keeps its label. Tracefern
  > verifies first: a camera photo stays a camera photo, and a changed
  > image says "Does not verify" and loses the label. It adds no badges
  > to your pages; it gives you the verdict a label can rely on.

- The same text in `trunk/readme.txt` and in the readme of the stable
  tag in SVN (see Open questions).

**Out of scope** (each needs its own spec before it may be built)

- Naming, linking or comparing any other plugin anywhere public.
- A sentence pointing to the Live Preview: added when the preview is
  public (SPEC-024), not before, so the page never points at a button
  that is not there.
- Tags, screenshots, banner, or any code.
- A hook through which label plugins could read the verdict.
- Publishing the measurement itself (an article, a table).

## Behavior

- **AC1 — The short description says "verifies"**
  - Given `readme.txt`
  - When the Unit test reads the first line after the header block
  - Then it equals the short description in Scope, and the existing
    limit (150 characters) still holds.

- **AC2 — The description opens with what is verified**
  - Given `readme.txt`
  - When the first paragraph of `== Description ==` is read
  - Then it starts with `**Verified, not just detected.**` and names the
    signature, the hash and the signer's certificate; its last sentence
    reads: Only when the signature and the hash hold does it show
    "AI-generated (signed)", and only when the signer is also on the
    trust list does it say "Verified".

- **AC3 — The FAQ answers the comparison first**
  - Given `readme.txt`
  - When the questions of `== Frequently Asked Questions ==` are listed
  - Then the first is "How is this different from plugins that label AI
    images?", and its answer names both patterns (any manifest counted
    as AI; a claim read without checking it) and both outcomes ("a
    camera photo stays a camera photo"; "Does not verify" and the label
    lost).

- **AC4 — No link to another plugin** *(error path)*
  - Given `readme.txt`
  - When every URL in it is listed
  - Then each is on an allow-list: the licence pages
    (`opensource.org/licenses/`, `creativecommons.org/licenses/`),
    `github.com/provemark/`, `github.com/c2pa-org/`, and this plugin's own
    page `wordpress.org/plugins/tracefern-image-check-for-c2pa`; a URL
    that is not, such as another plugin's page or site, fails the test
    with that URL. (Names are not tested: no list of other plugins is
    kept in the repository, by Maurice's decision of 2026-09-28; the
    text itself names none, which review of this spec checks.)

- **AC5 — The claims stay backed**
  - Given the fixtures of SPEC-024
  - When the SPEC-024 tests run (unchanged)
  - Then they still show the two outcomes the FAQ states: the Pixel 10
    photo without the AI label, and the changed OpenAI image as `Invalid`
    without it. This spec adds no test for it; it relies on SPEC-024
    AC2–AC3 and names them here so a change there is seen to touch this
    text.

- Measured 2026-09-28: four AI-label plugins from the directory, in
  Playground, each at its current version, installed from the directory
  with its defaults; the five fixtures imported, due cron events run, and
  every non-core attachment meta read. The code search of thirteen
  directory plugins that read C2PA. Which plugins they were is not
  recorded in the repository (Maurice's decision).
- Reasoned: that a readme-only edit of the stable tag is accepted without
  a new version (widely done for "Tested up to"; not stated in the
  handbook, which only discourages pushing *code* into a tag).

## API sketch

Not applicable: text in `readme.txt` and a Unit test in
`tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php`.

## Open questions

- **How it goes live** (blocker for the SVN step, not for building):
  (a) edit `readme.txt` in `trunk/` and in `tags/0.1.0/`, no new version:
  no update notice for sites, the page changes at once; the handbook does
  not forbid it for a readme but does not say so either. (b) Release
  0.1.1 with only this change: follows the handbook exactly, but every
  site gets an update for a text change. Proposal: (a).
  **Decided by Maurice, 2026-09-28: (a).**

## Amendment 1 (2026-09-29; approved by Maurice van Loon, 2026-09-29)

**Why.** On 2026-09-29 the directory search for "c2pa" gave 28 plugins
(plugin API, `query_plugins`, read that day). From their own
descriptions: most label images for the EU AI Act; several "detect" AI
through C2PA or IPTC metadata and say they do not check the signature.
One plugin, added to the directory that same day, does check it
cryptographically, in the administrator's browser, with the CAI's
`c2pa-web` library and without a trust list (its description: at best
"Valid / untrusted"). The FAQ answer below still describes the labelling
plugins correctly, but it now reads as if no other plugin verifies at
all. (Measured: the search and the descriptions. Not installed or run;
what the plugins do is what they say.)

**Change**, `readme.txt` only; no other plugin is named or linked (Out
of scope and AC4 unchanged):

- The answer to "How is this different from plugins that label AI
  images?" keeps its first paragraph, without its last sentence, and
  gains a second paragraph:

  > A few plugins verify too. Tracefern does it on the server, by itself,
  > for every upload, and checks the signer against the bundled C2PA
  > trust lists, so it can say "Verified" rather than only that the
  > signature holds. It adds no badges to your pages; it gives you the
  > verdict a label can rely on.

  (The last sentence moves from the first paragraph to the second.)
- It goes live as before: `readme.txt` in `trunk/` and in the stable
  tag's folder, no new version (Open questions, decided 2026-09-28).
- `readme.txt` stays under the 10,240 bytes its test enforces (about
  10,060 after this change).

**Criteria.** AC3 unchanged. New AC6 — *the answer names what sets the
verification apart*: the FAQ answer's second paragraph starts with "A
few plugins verify too." and names the server, every upload, the C2PA
trust lists and "Verified".

**Reasoned, not measured:** that a verdict made on the server at upload
is more useful to a site than one made in a browser when someone scans
(it is there for every image without anyone acting, and other code on
the server can use it, SPEC-026).

## Amendment 2 (2026-10-05; approved by Maurice van Loon, 2026-10-05)

SPEC-034 brings WAV, MP3 and FLAC in, so the short description no longer
says what is checked. AC1 now requires this short description, still
within the 150 characters (141):

> Verifies the Content Credentials (C2PA) of uploaded images and audio
> (signature, hash and signer) and shows the verdict in the Media Library.

It still says "verifies" and names the signer; AC2 to AC6 are unchanged.

## Traceability

Filled when status becomes `implemented`. Every acceptance criterion maps to at
least one test; every source file maps back to this spec.

| Acceptance criterion | Test (file :: name / group) | Source (file/symbol) |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| AC1                  | `tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php` :: SPEC-025 AC1 | `readme.txt` (short description) |
| AC2                  | `tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php` :: SPEC-025 AC2 | `readme.txt` (`== Description ==`, first paragraph) |
| AC3                  | `tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php` :: SPEC-025 AC3 | `readme.txt` (`== Frequently Asked Questions ==`, first question) |
| AC4                  | `tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php` :: SPEC-025 AC4 (the allow-list names the two GitHub repositories, `provemark/tracefern-image-check` and `provemark/c2pa-verifier`, rather than all of `github.com/provemark/`, which `tests/Unit/NameTest.php` also requires) | `readme.txt` (all URLs) |
| AC5                  | SPEC-024 AC2–AC3            | —                    |
| AC6 (amendment 1)    | `tests/Unit/ReadmeTest.php` :: SPEC-025 AC6 (amendment 1) | `readme.txt` (first FAQ answer, second paragraph) |
